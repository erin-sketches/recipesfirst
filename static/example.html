        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, combine yeast with 1/4 cup lukewarm water and 1 tablespoon
                of sugar. Mix until the yeast dissolves then set aside for 5 minutes. Stir in
                the milk, vanilla, egg substitute, and butter; reserve.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, mix the flour with 1/3 cup sugar, salt, and nutmeg. Make a
                well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour the yeast and milk mixture into
                the well. Mix the wet ingredients into the dry, forming a soft, smooth dough.
                Knead for 5-7 minutes, until dough is pretty stretchy. Cover the dough with a
                clean towel and set aside to rise in a warm place until dough doubles in size,
                about 1 hr. Optionally, after the first rise is done, punch down the dough and
                wait another hour.
                <div class="note">
                    Implementation note: If your kitchen is a bit frosty, you'll probably have to
                    do something special to find a warm place to rise the dough. One method is to
                    use an off oven (some of them are warm due to the pilot light). Another method
                    is to microwave a cup of water or so until it boils; then, quickly open the door
                    and put the dough in the microwave to rise)
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                With oiled fingers, pinch off pieces about the size of golf balls. Place the
                dough balls on greased baking sheets. Cover the malasadas with a clean towel and
                set aside to rise in a warm place for about 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a heavy, high-sided pot, heat about 1.5 in of oil over medium-high heat
                until the oil reaches 325 degrees F. Working in small batches, fry the malasadas
                (being very careful to not deflate them when putting them in the oil) until they
                are uniformly golden brown, 7-10 mins per batch. Drain the malasadas on a plate
                lined with paper towels just until they are cool enough to handle, then roll in
                cinnamon sugar. Rolling in cinnamon sugar can be accomplished either by tossing
                in a bowl or (my preferred method) by putting the malasadas in a gallon ziploc
                bag with the cinnamon sugar and shaking.

                In step 3, make a disk of dough and insert filling of choice into the center.
                Leave enough room to close edges of the disk. Seal seam as best you can, and
                leave to rise.
            </li>
            <li>
                In step 4, when first putting the dough into the oil, make sure to put the dough
                balls seam-side down. (If you don't do this, the seam is likely to break in the
                oil and you'll be sad.)
